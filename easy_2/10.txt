Even though Array1 and Array2 are different objects, their elements are the same string objects. When upcase! is called, it mutates the string objects in Array1 that are also referenced by Array2.

It's really important to be aware of what objects your variables are referencing, otherwise you may end up accidentally changing values in other parts of your program you didn't intend to. Avoid this by being deliberate and aware of your mutations, and using reassignment instead of mutating methods when you need to preserve old values.
